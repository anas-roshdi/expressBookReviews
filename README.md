📚 Express Book Reviews
A robust Back-End RESTful API for a book evaluation platform. This project demonstrates proficiency in Node.js, asynchronous programming, and secure user authentication. 

✨ Features:
🔐 Secure Authentication: User registration and login system powered by JWT and Session-based authentication.

📖 Comprehensive Book Catalog: Public endpoints to browse books by ISBN, Author, or Title.

💬 Review Management: Authenticated users can add, modify, and delete their own book reviews.

⚡ Async Performance: Optimized data handling using Async/Await, Promises, and Axios for non-blocking operations.

🛡️ Data Integrity: Middleware implementation to ensure users can only manage their personal reviews.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
🟢 Runtime: Node.js

🚀 Framework: Express.js

🔑 Security: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Express-Session

📡 HTTP Client: Axios (for Async data fetching)

💾 Database: Local JSON Database (MockDB)

🚀 Implementation Highlights:
Asynchronous Logic: Used Array.prototype.filter within Async functions to efficiently query book data. 

Modular Routing: Organized the application using Express Routers for cleaner code maintainability.

Error Handling: Implemented robust try-catch blocks to ensure consistent API responses and status codes.
